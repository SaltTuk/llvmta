The pourpose of this program is to convert an hex file into a mif.
This is necessary because the formatted style used in the hex file
makes it impossible to simulate directly with vsim.

how to use: from terminal call "hex2mif <name of hex file without extension>"
				e.g. "hex2mif my_function"

right now the conversion is only available for memory of dimension 8192 and
width of 32. If you have different parameters, change the source and compile.

compile using standard c++11

e.g. for linux: g++ -std=c++11 hex2mif.cpp
